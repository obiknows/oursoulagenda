## Voodoo Vegan

![Voodoo Vegan](./img/voodoo-vegan.jpg)

One of our top vegan spots hands down! Serving up plant-based creole food, it’s a taste of The South in LA. Everything we’ve ever tasted from here is on point and delicious. The Mac and cheese is the best vegan Mac we’ve ever had and the “shrimp” is next level. Juicy and all that. Getcha some. 

#### Our Favorite Order
Everything on the menu. These ladies be throwin' down wherever they go.

- Mac and Cheese. (Hands Down Best)
- Anything with the shrimp. 
- Anything Else. There are no wrong options. 

This is a pop-up restaurant that serves the LA area, find them on Instagram here [Voodoo Vegan (@voodooveganfood)](https://www.instagram.com/voodooveganfood/)

## Monty’s Good Burger 

![Monty's](https://cdn2.lamag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/08/Montys-burgers-and-tots-1-1068x712.jpg)

We Believe the hype. 

Monty’s is known for one thing and one thing only—**BURGERS**. And they are delicious. They use the Impossible Burger 2.0(definitely not something to eat everyday, or at all if you really health conscious) but it truly is the perfect place for when you are craving vegan junk food. We don't eat alot of sugar, but we had to make an exception because the brownies are flame too. We even took my non-vegan dad here and he loved it!

#### Our Favorite Order 
- Double with everything, tater tots with onion ailoi
- Middle of the brownie cookie. 
- Get the dog pile off of the secret menu if you’re feeling frisky. 
  
#### Parking

Pro tip is to park at the Walgreens a few blocks away and walk over. Near Echo Park and Elysian Park so you can eat by some trees. There are also a ton of vintage and thrift shops nearby that you can explore. 

#### Address

Monty's Good Burger <br/>
1533 W Sunset Blvd <br/>

Service is also amazing here and they have a fancy Japanese toilet in the ladies room.

- Kiss of the Spider Woman
- Spicy Baked Scallop Roll (garlic free)

## World Empanadas

![World Empanadas](https://cdn.usarestaurants.info/assets/uploads/fa6813f97c9a2c7f7480341f1e61d01c_-united-states-california-los-angeles-county-burbank-801272-world-empanadashtm.jpg)

We are no empanada experts, but these empanadas go hard! Savory, filling and filled with real nutritious veggies—you will be back for more. The crust is crisp and buttery (without the butter) and the fillings are well seasoned.  Definitely stop by for a snack or a full meal if you're in the Burbank area. 

#### Our Favorite Order

Every single savory vegan empanada! We typically split a dozen and get multiples of our favorites. 
- Quinoa & Lentils
- Mushroom & Cashew Cheese
- Pinto Beans & Rice

#### Parking

Street parking, typically always available. Short drive to Griffith Park, so you can make a picnic out of it if you’d like. 

#### Address

World Empanadas <br/>
1206 W Magnolia Blvd <br/>
Burbank, CA 91506
