**THE TOWN!** Oakland is one of our favorite cities and was the place we called home before starting van life.
There are a ton of vegan options in the area, and we're sharing our favorite spots with you.

## Bare Knuckle Pizza

![Bare Knuckle Pizza](https://media2.fdncms.com/eastbayexpress/imager/u/original/8271453/02_bareknucklepizza_andrialo.jpg)

_The BEST VEGAN PIZZA._ No competition. Hands down. We've yet to have any other pizza that remotely compares to the level of deliciousness. They use a mozzarella from The Butcher's Son, a vegan restaurant nearby in Berkeley, which tastes just like the real thing. None of those nasty Daiya cheese shreds like most other vegan pizza places. If you like New York style pizza and appreciate a good crust, then you gotta eat here. At $18 for a personal pizza, it'd definitely not the cheapest but its very much worth every penny.

#### Our Favorite Order


- TKO (Portobello Mushrooms, Mozzarella, Truffle Oil) 
- Supremo (Sausage, Pepperoni, Bacon, Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce)

#### Parking

Street, tough to find during 9-5 work hours. Since it typically takes 20 minutes to get your pizza, we suggest placing a pick-up order and eating it by Lake Merritt. Check the restaurant hours before you visit as they are only open on some days. 

#### Address

Bare Knuckle Pizza <br/>
351 12th St  <br/>
Oakland, CA 94607

Our favorite Ethiopian spot. The food and the portions leave us full everytime and serve as the perfect comfort food for a chilly night. You can even make reservations for a 30 minute Ethiopian coffee ceremony for a one-of-a-kind experience.

#### Our Favorite Order

- Mitten Shiro (House-Made Chickpea Flour, Berber spices, garlic) 

#### Parking

Street parking is availabe in the surrounding neighborhood.

#### Address

Cafe Romanat <br/>
462 Santa Clara Ave <br/>

## Mr. Dewie's Cashew Creamery

![Cashew Creamery](https://www.bayareamade.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Mr-Dewies-Upside-Down-Cones.jpeg)

This vegan, cashew based ice cream will blow your mind. It's mad creamy and does not melt as quickly as traditional ice cream, meaning more time to enjoy (especially on a summer day). Certain flavors are definitely better than others, so be sure to sample before ordering--they'll let you try as many as you'd like!

#### Our Favorite Order

- Turmeric Spice and Coffee Double Cone 
- Cookie Sandwich with a Caramel Almond Scoop Inbetween

#### Parking

On site. The Creamery is located in the Emeryville Public Market with a ton of other restaurants and there's a free parking lot on site.

#### Address


Public Market Emeryville <br/>
5959 Shellmound St <br/>
Emeryville, CA 94608

## Falafel Boy

Delicious fresh made falafel--no powdered mix over here! Super quick service and close enough to Lake Merritt that you can eat outside on a sunn day.

#### Our Favorite Order

- Falafel Wraps (make sure to ask to make it Vegan so you avoid the white sauce)

#### Parking

Street Parking. Best to go outside of 9-5 Weekday Work Hours for a better chance at parking

#### Address

Falafel Boy <br/>
1924 Franklin St <br/>
Oaklan, CA 94612

## Millenium

![Millenium](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/06/70/45/1804656/5/920x920.jpg)

For a fancy night out and upscale vegan dining, this is the place to go when you want to dress up a little (but not too much cause Oakland's chill) and treat yourself! Dishes have a depth of flavor that hard to come by at most vegan restaurants, and lots of unique flavor combinations

#### Our Favorite Order

- Coriander & Arborio Crusted Oyster Mushrooms
- Honestly anything else on the menu, minus the Tofu (Obinna)

#### Parking

Street Parking Only

#### Address

Millenium Oakland <br/>
5912 College Ave <br/>
Oakland, CA 94618
