How will I shower? How will I stay active? These are two questions that you must answer when starting van life. For us, both of these questions have the same answer--Planet Fitness! Planet Fitness is where we shower, work out and even park overnight occasionally. Below are our top reasons why Planet Fitness is the best gym for van life.

## Location, Location, Location

There are over 1,800 Planet Fitness locations within the United States. Many of them are in major towns and to date we have yet to make it more than a 5 hour drive without finding multiple locations. If you have a Planet Fitness Black Card, you’ll also be able to visit any location across the country. You can see a full map of Planet Fitness locations [here](https://www.planetfitness.com/gyms/).

## Two for One Affordable Pricing

If you are van lifing with another person, the Black Card Planet Fitness membership allows one person to always bring a guest. That means that you only have to pay for one person and two people get to for the gym. The Black Card member will also get access to the Black Card lounge where they have massage chairs. The membership typically costs around $24.

## Showers & Changing ROoms

Every single Planet Fitness has at least 3 showers and 3 changing rooms, so you can take your time and do your cleaning routine in peace. If you do not go during peak hours (8-9am or 5-6:30pm) there is rarely a wait for the showers or changing rooms.

## The Details


#### The Planet Fitness Black Card fine print says that I only have 10 non-home gym visits per month, so how does that work?
Congrats on being detail oriented! We were worried about this when we started van life as well. The beautiful truth is that you will not be limited to only 10 visits at non home gyms, and you can visit any Planet Fitness as many times that you want, and the limit is not enforced whatsoever. 

#### How does bringing a guest to Planet Fitness work?
If it’s the first time bringing a guest, the guest will be required to show an ID, sign a waiver, provide their phone number and take a photo. Once you visit the same location or a location that is owned by the same franchisee, the guest will only have to provide their phone number to be checked in. Many locations within one state will all use the same system, so you do not end up having to do the full process that often. 

#### Any other perks?
Every location provides free pizza one day a month and free bagels another day of the month. 

#### Can my kids shower at Planet Fitness too?
Children over 13 are allowed to visit Planet Fitness, but kids under 13 are technically not allowed to enter the facility.
