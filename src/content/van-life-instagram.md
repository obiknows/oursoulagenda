These days, the majority of people find out about van life through social media. The hashtag #vanlife has over 6 million photos on Instagram alone! Clearly there is an audience for van life journeys, but does that mean you should share your journey online as well? It's a big question to ask and we’re here to help you figure it out! Below are a few questions that you should ask yourself before creating a van life Instagram page.

### Do you have an idea of what you want to post?

Your van life account does not have to simply be a million photos of you in and around your vehicle. Think of it more as a van lifestyle account. That means that you should highlight any and all parts of this lifestyle that are meaningful and interesting to you. For example, if you are on a quest to visit every national park, then take photos at each park and share something meaningful about your experience there in the captions. Are you a city-living van lifer? Then take pictures around the city and talk about the unique challenges and benefits that van living brings you. Love taking photos of other people’s rigs on the road? Then share your pictures and say why their van caught your eye. Love to cook? Then share photos of the delicious meals you make and be ready for when people as for recipes.

Being successful on social media is all about finding the perfect combination of the content you like to create and what content resonates with your audience. So don’t be afraid to experiment and pay attention to what works and what does not work for you.

### Are you interested in engaging with the larger van life community?

The #vanlife community on Instagram is very active and there are a ton of smaller communities within the larger hashtag. Starting a van life instagram account is one of the easiest ways to join the community and to be in the know of what's happening nationwide and even internationally! There are multiple meetups that happen every year, and you can make your own impromptu meetup by reaching out to van lifers you'd like to meet.

Another benefit of joining the community is having people to reach out to for advice. Whether it’s for planning a route through Mexico, surviving winter van life or getting troubleshooting tips when your van won’t start—the van life community is known for helping and sharing useful tips and tricks.

There are also downsides that come with tapping into the community that you should be aware of.  A major one being the tendency to compare your journey or your vehicle to the seemingly perfect images that others share online. Be sure to limit the time you spend online looking at others online, and remind yourself that there is no such thing as a perfect, problem-free life.

### What parts of your life and journey do you actually want to share?

How much and how little you decide to share on Instagram is your choice. Be mindful of how much you share of your life because social media is a place where everyone believes they are entitled to an opinion on anything that is shared with them. There are different ways to share stories on Instagram based on how much of your life you want to share. For instance, you could never show your face and only share photos of landscapes and your vehicle. 

If you want to speak about specific things that a broader audience might not understand, then take ownership over your space and be mindful of who you allow to comment and partake in dialogue.

### Are you doing this just to become an #influencer?

Influencers are not created over night. If your goal is to have anything over 1,000 followers and you do not already have a large following online, it will take hard work and consistency to grow your account. If being able to get paid for posting sponsored content is something you wish to do in the future, then you need to treat Instagram like a job and not a hobby. That means putting yourself on a posting schedule and consistently taking high quality, staged photos that you edit in order to create a consistent look on your page. Consistency is the key, so make sure that you are in it for the long haul.

We do not suggest buying followers as this will hurt your account in the long run, because the bought followers will never comment or like any of your posts. Engagement is becoming more and more important on Instagram, so instead of focusing on how many followers you want to have, focus on growing and engaging with the followers that you already have. Plus who wants to be any of those accounts with 10,000 followers and only 100 likes on a photo.
