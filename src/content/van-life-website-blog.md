### Share on Your Own Terms

An Instagram caption will never tell the full story and a Youtube video can’t cover your internal dialogue. Start blogging and sharing your journey on your website to give a more full picture of what your van life experience has been like. It’s a great place to share any deep reflections you’ve had and any tips of tricks that you’ve figured out along the way. Blogging is not a thing of the past! There are still many perspectives missing from the greater dialogue that need ti be shared and heard. Remember how clueless you were at the beginning of your journey? Let your blog be a place where others can get answers from someone who is experienced.

### OWN Your Content

Instagram and Youtube are hot right now, but will it last? Will a video that you posted on Youtube get taken down or demonetized? Will your followers still see your posts once the Instagram algorithm changes? These are all important questions to consider as a content creator.

Having a website also means that if social media is down one day, your audience will automatically know where to find you, because you’ve already told them!

### Professional Branding

A website transforms your online presence into a professional brand. Having a branded website shows people that you are serious about the work that you do and that you deserve to be taken (and paid) seriously! Your website serves as a central hub and introduction to your brand where you have full control over the format and way in which you tell your story. For example, if someone finds you from Instagram and goes to your website they can discover that you have a Youtube channel, that you are a video editor that can help them edit their one videos, and that you also have super cool t-shirts for sale!
