Staying connected and doing online work on the road are important to many van lifers. Below are our go-to places for getting free wifi while on the road. We’d also suggest getting an unlimited data cellular plan and using your hotspot if you prefer to work later at night.

## The Local Library

Most places in the US have a local library with fast wi-fi. We highly recommend libraries as you will never be expected to buy anything or questioned if you stay there for hours because that’s what they are for! In addition, when you need a break from the computer screen or if you get tired of searching the internet for answers—grab a book and read it while you’re there. This is also the best place to upload Youtube videos.

*Pros:* Access to Outlets, Quiet, No Purchase Neccessary, Bathrooms

*Cons:* Many Close Early

## Starbucks

Starbucks is many people’s go-to for free wi-fi, and many towns have multiple Starbucks locations in a small radius. We often go to Starbucks or sit in Starbucks parking lots to use the wi-fi. As we are not coffee drinkers and make our own herbal tea blends, we never purchase anything and simply just sit there and get our work done. The best hours are from 10am-3pm as it is before kids come to hang out after school and before adults come after work.

*Pros:* Open Late, Access to Outlets, Bathrooms
*Cons:* Crowded on Weekends, Noisy

## McDonald’s

There are McDonald’s EVERYWHERE, and many of them are open late. All locations have free wifi and they tend to be pretty fast since most people do not go there to get any work done. We prefer to stay in our van and use the wifi while in the comfort of our own home. Note that some locations have outlets inside while most do not have any.

*Pros:* Open Late, Work in Your Vehicle

*Cons:* No Outlets

## Home Depot or Lowe’s Parking Lot

A true hidden gem! If you park relatively near the entrance, you should have extra speedy wifi. This is a great option if you want to get work done and also do other things like cook or work on a home improvement project in your van. They are generally used to people doing odd things in their parking lots, so you will usually never be bothered as long as you keep it lowkey.

*Pros:* Work in Your Vehicle

*Cons:* Many Closed by 9pm
